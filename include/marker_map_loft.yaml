# id's, locations, and orientations of markers

# Format:
#   Marker_id:
#   - id (as int)
#   - length (incl. black boundary, as float in [m])
#   - [x, y, z] (as floats, in [m])
#     - center of marker, distance from origin at ground level
#   - [rot_x, rot_y, rot_z] (as floats, in [rad], about given axis)
#     - Note that the donkeycar map still requires:
#       -  [rot_x, rot_y, rot_z] = [0.0, 0.0, rot_z]
#       - But qualcomm runs ROS and can handle 6 DOF marker poses
#     - [0.0, 0.0, 0.0] matches with origin frame
#     - increase rot_x by rotating ccw (onto side) facing origin
#     - increase rot_y by putting marker face down when facing origin
#     - increase rot_z by rotating ccw looking down at marker
